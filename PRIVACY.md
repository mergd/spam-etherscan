# Privacy Policy

**Spam Etherscan Filter** · Last updated February 23, 2026

## Overview

Spam Etherscan Filter is a browser extension that hides likely-spam token transfers on Etherscan-family block explorers. It does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.

## Data Collection

This extension collects **no personal data**. No analytics, no telemetry, no tracking, no cookies, no network requests to external servers.

## Local Storage

Filter preferences (USD threshold, token allowlist) are stored via `chrome.storage.sync`. This data stays within your browser and Chrome profile sync — it is never sent to us or any third party.

## Host Permissions

The extension requires access to Etherscan-family domains solely to inject a content script that hides spam transaction rows. No page content is extracted, logged, or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

None.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be published here with a new date.
